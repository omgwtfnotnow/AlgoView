# **App Name**: AlgoView

## Core Features:

- Search Visualizer: Visualize searching algorithms: users can select from searching algorithms (e.g., linear search, binary search) and visualize how they search for a specific element within a dataset.
- Sort Visualizer: Visualize sorting algorithms: users can select from sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, merge sort, quicksort) and watch the step-by-step process of sorting a dataset.
- Control Simulation: Adjustable speed and data size: Users can control the speed of the visualization and the size of the dataset to better understand algorithm performance under different conditions.
- Smart Suggestion: Algorithm Recommendation Tool: The app suggests suitable searching/sorting algorithms based on dataset characteristics using an AI tool.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light blue (#64B5F6) for a calm and intellectual feel.
- Background color: Off-white (#F0F8FF), to keep the focus on the visualizations.
- Accent color: Orange (#FFB74D) for interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for clear data representation.
- Use simple, geometric icons to represent algorithm types and control functions.
- A clean and intuitive layout to facilitate easy interaction and understanding.
- Smooth, clear animations to visualize algorithm steps.
